# Ninext

I'm dropping here a series of HTML code for Ninox that allows to add features :

- **badges.html**: displays a badge on file and comment icons indicating the number of items contained in each.

- **evalJS.html**: adds a hook function to the Ninox eval function which allows to add new user functions, like for example EvalJS to call JavaScript from the Ninox script. 

- **completion.html**: sets the Ninox code editor to display an auto-completion list. To display the list, press **crtl+space** on Ninox Editor.

To use the features, copy the content of the .html files into a formula. The functions are activated as soon as the formula is executed by Ninox.
 
Don't hesitate to write to me if you spot any bugs or if you need a particular feature.
